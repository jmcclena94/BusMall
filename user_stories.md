These are user stories for the BusMall problem.

As a user, I want to:
-Have clear instructions as to what actions to take and where to click on the website.


As a developer I want to:
-Select three random images from my image database and have them appear onscreen.
-Make sure that none of the images are repeated onscreen at one time.
-Take data on what image the user clicked and store that data.
-Compile the collected data and display it in a useful and visually appealing format after the user has made 15 selections.

As a business owner I want to:
-Get useful marketing information regarding the images I supply to my developer.
